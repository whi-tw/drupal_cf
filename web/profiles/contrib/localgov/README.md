# LocalGov Drupal

Drupal distribution and install profile to help UK councils collaborate and
share Drupal code for publishing website content.

## Requirements for installing LocalGov Drupal locally

to install locally, you will need Composer and Lando. 

https://getcomposer.org/
https://lando.dev/

Also see the Lando requirements section for details of Docker requirements.

## Installing LocalGov Drupal locally

To install LocalGov Drupal locally for testing or development, use the
[Composer-based project template](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_project).

Change `MY_PROJECT` to whatever you'd like your project directory to be called.

```bash
composer create-project --stability dev localgovdrupal/localgov-project MY_PROJECT
```

Change directory into the MY_PROJECT directory and run lando start.

```bash
cd MY_PROJECT
lando start
```

Once lando has finished building, run the site installer.

```bash
lando drush si localgov -y
```
## Composer notes

If developing locally and you want to force composer to clone again
from source rather than use composer cache, you can add the `--no-cache` flag.

```bash
composer create-project localgovdrupal/localgov-project MY_PROJECT --stability dev --no-cache
```

If you just want to pull in the latest changes to LocalGov Drupal run composer
update with the `--no-cache` flag.

```bash
composer update --no-cache
```

If you want to be sure you are getting the latest commits when developing,
clearing composer cache, deleting the folders and re-running composer update
seems to be a solid approach:

```bash

rm -rf web/profiles/contrib/ web/modules/contrib/ web/themes/contrib/;
composer clear-cache; composer update --with-dependencies --no-cache;
lando start;
lando drush si localgov -y;

```

If you run into [memory limit errors](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md#memory-limit-errors)
when running Composer commands, prefix the commands with `COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1`.
For example, to install the project run:

```bash
COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1 composer create-project --stability dev localgovdrupal/localgov-project MY_PROJECT
```

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for current contribution guidelines.

## Issue tracking

In the early development stages, most issues will be tracked in this repository
<https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov/issues>.

Development issues relating to specific projects or module should be tracked in
the project repository. In the future we might set up a separate repository for
centralised issue tracking of bug reports for end users.

## Development setup

The main development environment in use is currently
[Lando](https://docs.lando.dev/) â€“ a Docker based development environment that
works on Linux, MacOS and Windows.

@todo Document Lando setup.

## Coding standards

PHP CodeSniffer is installed as a dev dependency by Composer and configured to
use Drupal coding standards and best practices. It is a good idea to run these
before committing any code. All code in pull requests should pass all
CodeSniffer tests.

To check code using Lando run:

```bash
lando phpcs
```

To attempt to automatically fix coding errors in Lando run:

```bash
lando phix
```

### Coding standards resources

* [Drupal coding standards](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards)

## Running tests

The included `phpunit.xml.dist` file contains configuration for automatically
running the LocalGov Drupal test suite.

To run all LocalGov Drupal tests with Lando use:

```bash
lando phpunit
```

To run all the tests for a specific module use:

```bash
lando phpunit web/modules/contrib/localgov_my_module
```

Tests can be filtered using the `--filter` option. To only run a specific test
use:

```bash
lando phpunit --filter=myTestName
```
